##Overview
This project is the result of the Lynda.com course called AngularJS 1: Building a Data-Driven App. I started this project so that I could follow along with the requirements of my job as a UI Developer at Highmark. Their code base uses Angular.

##Organization
Project is organized with a final project in the master branch. I did not save to a new branch with each level in this course. In the folder 'builds' is the final project containing all of the code that I worked on. The folder 'builds_o' is the original builds folder that I downloaded from the course repository GitHub course repository. The folder 'AnuglarJS' contains OneNote notebooks that I kept for notes for each of the load-bearing courses. Each section is a chapter in the course, with pages corresponding to course videos. Each page has a transcript of the video taken from the course, annotated with instruction specific code highlighting.

##Notes
The current package.json file is configured to require browserSync and related compilers to start with the directive 'npm start' instead of the more traditional 'npm gulp' or 'npm grunt'. This was to accommodate limitations with utilizing Highmark's secure machines.

##Install
Make sure you have npm and git installed before cloning this repository. Then install all of the necessary node packets using 'npm install'. To run BrowserSync, use 'npm start'.
